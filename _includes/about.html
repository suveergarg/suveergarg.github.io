<p style="text-align:justify">I am a full-stack roboticist interested in building autonomous systems that leave the laboratory and solve real-world problems. I graduated in May 2021 with a Masters in Systems Engineering from the University of Pennsylvania. As a senior robotics software engineer at Oishii, I maintain the operations of 60 production strawberry harvesting robots with minimal downtime. My work resulted in improving pick accuracy by 25% and reducing collateral damage to under 5%. During my two years at the Samsung AI Center in NYC, I contributed to research in computer vision, path planning and controls. The research resulted in 4 publications in top robotics conferences(ICRA and IROS) and 3 patents. I also engineered full autonomous systems on a mobile base and 7-DOF manipulator to demonstrate the applications of our research. I am looking for full-time roles in computer vision, path planning or machine learning.</p>
