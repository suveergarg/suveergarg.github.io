<p>I am excited about the possibilities that technology offers to impact those at the bottom of the pyramid. I wish to combine my interests in systems engineering with the social sciences and ongoing efforts in sustainbility research. I completed my undergraduate studies in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Delhi Technological University. Currently I am working as a Systems Engineer at a startup, Addverb Technologies, developing Automated Ground Vehicles for warehouses. I am looking venture into fields that allow interdisciplinary work and hope to serve the underserved or build a sustainable future.</p>
