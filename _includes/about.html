<p>My interests lie in the application of cyber physical systems to build intelligent solutions for smart-cities, robotics and environmental sustainability. After an undergraduate career in Electronics and Communications Engineering from India's premier Delhi Technological University, I build a multi-robot parcel sorting system for a robotics startup, Addverb. I am now a first year Masters student in Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. My relevant subjects are Computer Vision, Edge Computing: Internet of Things and Embedded Software. I am actively looking for summer internships in embedded software, computer vision and machine learning</p>
