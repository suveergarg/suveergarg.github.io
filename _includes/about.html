<p>I am excited about the possibilities that technology offers to impact those at the bottom of the pyramid. I wish to combine my interest in electronics, computer science with the social sciences and ongoing efforts in sustainbility research. I completed my undergraduate in Electronics and Communications Engineering from Delhi Technological University, New Delhi. I wish to take on interdisciplinary work in the aforementioned fields.</p>
